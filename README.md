In this code we solve 3 different exercises, the first is using the dataset Pima.tr and Pima.te, from the R packege MASS. We use in that exercise some known methods such as:

*Discriminant analysis*
*Naive Bayes*
*Logistic Regression*
*SVM*

In the second excersice, we adjust a model privileging the predictive aspect. For this we use the packege nnet, and to run the code you must change the path of Glucose1.txt to the path of your computer once that you dowload the file (line 1416).

Last but not least, we use the dataset June 13 data.csv and the Gamma Regression model with link function ¨log¨.
